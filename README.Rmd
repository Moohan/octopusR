octopusR is an R package that provides access to the [Octopus Energy API](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/). With octopusR, you can easily retrieve data from the Octopus Energy API and use it in your R projects.

## Installation
octopusR is not yet avaliable on CRAN, so must be installed from GitHub, to install, you can use the `devtools` package:

```r
# Install devtools if needed
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moohan/octopusR")
```

## Usage
To use most function in octopusR, you will need an API key from Octopus Energy, you can find this on the [developer dahsboard](https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/). Once you have your API key, you can use the `set_api_key()` function to interactively input and store the API key for the session:

```r
library(octopusR)

# Set your API key
set_api_key()
```

Once you have authenticated with the API, you may also want to set your meter-point details.

```r
# Set details for your electricity meter
set_meter_details(meter_type = "electricity")

# Set details for your gas meter
set_meter_details(meter_type = "gas")
```

You can use the other functions in the package to interact with the API. For example, you can use the `get_consumption()` function to retrieve data about your energy usage:

```r
# Get data about your energy usage
energy_usage <- get_consumption(meter_type = "electricity")

# View the data
head(energy_usage)
```

For more information and examples, see the [package documentation](https://moohan.github.io/octopusR/) and the [Octopus Energy API documentation](https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/).
