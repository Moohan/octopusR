\arguments{
\item{meter_type}{Type of meter-point, electricity or gas}

\item{mpan_mprn}{The electricity meter-point's MPAN or gas meter-pointâ€™s MPRN.}

\item{serial_number}{The meter's serial number.}

\item{api_key}{Your API key. If you are an Octopus Energy customer, you can generate an API key from your \href{https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/}{online dashboard}.}

\item{period_from}{Show consumption from the given datetime (inclusive). This parameter can be provided on its own.}

\item{period_to}{Show consumption to the given datetime (exclusive). This parameter also requires providing the \code{period_from} parameter to create a range.}

\item{page_size}{Page size of returned results. Default is 100, maximum is 25,000 to give a full year of half-hourly consumption details.}

\item{order_by}{Ordering of results returned. Default is that results are returned in reverse order from latest available figure.
Valid values:
\itemize{
\item \code{period}, to give results ordered forward.
\item \code{-period}, (default), to give results ordered from most recent backwards.
}}

\item{group_by}{Aggregates consumption over a specified time period. A day is considered to start and end at midnight in the server's timezone. The default is that consumption is returned in half-hour periods.
Accepted values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{hour}
\item \code{day}
\item \code{week}
\item \code{month}
\item \code{quarter}
}}
}
\value{
a \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} of the requested consumption data.
}
\description{
Return a list of consumption values for half-hour periods for a given meter-point and meter.

Unit of measurement:
\itemize{
\item Electricity meters: kWh
\item SMETS1 Secure gas meters: kWh
\item SMETS2 gas meters: m^3
}
